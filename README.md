## Description 

My first front-end/ client-side javascript application. As the only programming language native to web browsers, JavaScript is used all over the web and I was able to see first hand at how versatile it can through this application. 

I modified starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
